# CSEHomeworks1
This folder contains the homeworks and projects I completed during my first year in the Marmara University Computer Science and Engineering Department.

Approximately 75% of the content consists of code written in Java, while the remaining part includes code written in C. These assignments and projects mark the early stages of my software development journey, so they may contain amateurish errors, lack of comments, and include syntax mistakes.

Up to HW6 is my first semester which is Computer Engineering 1 lesson, after HW6 is my second semester which is Computer Engineering 2 lesson.
