# CSEHomeworks1
This folder contains the homeworks and projects I completed during my first year in the Marmara University Computer Science and Engineering Department.

Approximately 75% of the content consists of code written in Java, while the remaining part includes code written in C. These assignments and projects mark the early stages of my software development journey, so they may contain amateurish errors, lack of comments, and include syntax mistakes.
